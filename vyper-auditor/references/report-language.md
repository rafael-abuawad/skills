# Report language — Simplified Technical English

Every sentence a human reads in the report obeys this file. The rules are ASD-STE100
(Simplified Technical English), reduced to the part an audit finding needs.

## Why

A report is read by the developer who must fix the code, often at speed, often not in their
first language. A sentence they must decode twice costs the fix, and the bug stays in the
code. The scan is only as good as the sentence that delivers it.

Short words do not make a finding less rigorous. The **Proof** block carries the trace, values, and source evidence.
The **Fix** block carries the verified corrective code. The sentence exists to say what breaks and who breaks it.

## What this covers

Four pieces of text, and no others:

- the finding **title**
- the **Description** sentence
- the **Lead** description
- the **code smells** list on a Lead

## What it must never touch

These are data, not prose. Rewriting one of them for readability breaks the scan:

- **Vyper identifiers** — contract, function, variable and event names. They are printed as
  the source spells them. `withdraw_to_native_chain` is never softened to `withdraw to chain`.
- **The diff inside a Fix block.** It is code. It is pasted verbatim from the agent that wrote
  it, and `judging.md` and `dedup-and-assembly.md` both forbid paraphrase there.
- **The bug-class label** (`zero-abort-address`). It is the third segment of a memory key.
  The same bug under a plainer word is a second ledger record, so memory remembers it twice
  and recognises it never. Labels are chosen by the rules in `dedup-and-assembly.md` step 1,
  never by this file.
- **Fixed strings the assembler prints** — the banner, the Scope table headers, the italic
  lines under Leads and "Known from earlier scans", the disclaimer. They are in
  `assemble.sh` and they are already written.

## The rules

1. **One sentence, one idea.** A Description is one sentence. A Lead description is one or
   two. Never three.
2. **Twenty-five words is the ceiling.** Count them. Over the ceiling means two ideas in one
   sentence — cut it or split it.
3. **Active voice, and name the actor.** Who does this? Write that word first.
   - No: `Funds can be drained due to a missing check.`
   - Yes: `Any caller can take all the tokens, because the function checks no caller.`
4. **Simple present tense.** The code does this today. Not `would be able to`, not
   `could potentially`. If the path is uncertain it is a Lead, and the Lead says which step
   is unproven.
5. **No `-ing` clauses.** They hide the actor and the order of events. Use `that`, `so`, or a
   second sentence.
   - No: `Missing access control allowing anyone to drain the vault.`
   - Yes: `The function has no access control, so any caller can take all the tokens.`
6. **Keep the articles.** `the`, `a`, `an`. Telegraphic style — `Function reverts on zero
   amount` — is not shorter to read, only shorter to type.
7. **Three nouns in a row is the limit.** Break a longer stack with `of`, `for` or `in`.
   - No: `cross-chain message replay protection gap`
   - Yes: `the contract does not stop a replay of a cross-chain message`
8. **One word for one thing, every time.** Pick `token`, or pick `asset`, and use that word
   in the title, the Description and the fix. A synonym reads as a second thing.
9. **No metaphor, no idiom, no slang.** See the table below. A metaphor is a word the reader
   must translate before they can act.
10. **Say what happens, not how bad it is.** `catastrophic`, `critical`, `severe` and
    `trivially` carry no information — the confidence number and the Fix block carry it. Write
    the effect: `the caller keeps the tokens and the pool keeps the debt`.
11. **Positive statements. No double negatives.** `The check is absent` beats `the check is
    not present`.
12. **Event order is sentence order.** Cause, then effect. `The price comes from the pool
    balance, so an attacker who moves the balance moves the price.`
13. **A title is one clause, twelve words or fewer,** present tense, active, and it names the
    defect or its effect. `Swap trusts a spot price as an oracle.`
    Not `Oracle manipulation vulnerability in swap functionality`.

## Words to replace

Left column: the wording to keep out of the report. Right column: what the report prints.

| Do not write | Write |
| --- | --- |
| burns the funds | sends the tokens to an address that cannot spend them |
| bricks the contract | makes the function fail for every caller, forever |
| rug / rugpull | the owner takes the user deposits |
| griefing | an attacker makes the function fail for other users |
| footgun | (delete the word and name the defect) |
| silently swallows the error | ignores the error |
| DoS / denial of service | blocks every caller |
| attack surface / attack vector | path |
| malicious actor / bad actor | an attacker |
| leverages / utilizes | uses |
| is able to | can |
| in order to | to |
| arbitrary value | any value the caller chooses |
| stale price | old price |
| sanity check | check |
| happy path | the normal path |
| atomically | in one transaction |
| trustlessly / permissionlessly | (delete, or name who may call) |
| non-zero | more than zero |
| cascading failures | (name each failure) |
| exponentially / trivially / catastrophically | (delete) |
| edge case | (name the input or the state) |

## Technical names stay

STE-100 keeps technical names, and a security report cannot work without them:
`reentrancy`, `slippage`, `oracle`, `revert`, `overflow`, `rounding`, `allowance`, `nonce`,
`slot`, `delegatecall`. Use them. They are precise and the reader who fixes Vyper knows
them.

The rule is what goes **around** them: name the mechanism once with its technical name, then
say in plain words what the attacker gets.

- No: `Classic CEI violation enabling reentrant drainage of the vault.`
- Yes: `The function sends ETH before it lowers the balance, so a reentrant call withdraws
  the same deposit twice.`

## Worked examples

Before, and after. The code the sentence describes did not change.

**One**

- Before: `Improper validation of the abort address results in a catastrophic loss of user
  funds via burning to the zero address.`
- After: `The function accepts a zero abort address, so a failed transfer sends the tokens to
  an address that nobody controls.`

**Two**

- Before: `Lack of slippage protection in the swap path exposes users to sandwich attacks,
  potentially leading to significant value extraction by MEV searchers.`
- After: `The swap sets the minimum output to zero, so an attacker who trades before and
  after the victim keeps most of the output.`

**Three — a Lead**

- Before: `Potential accounting inconsistency stemming from asymmetric fee handling on
  deposit/withdraw flows warranting further investigation.`
- After: `The deposit takes the fee from the amount, and the withdrawal takes it from the
  balance. We did not find the input that makes the two disagree.`

## Self-check before you write the block

Four questions. Any `no` means rewrite the sentence, not the code:

- Does the sentence name **who** acts and **what** they get?
- Is it one sentence, twenty-five words or fewer, with no `-ing` clause?
- Is every word in it a word the reader does not have to translate?
- Are the identifiers, the label and the diff exactly as the source and the agent wrote them?
